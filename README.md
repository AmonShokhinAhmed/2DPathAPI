# 2DPathAPI
**2DPathAPI** was made for my *Game Engine Design* course and provides an outline for a simple path finding library. It is not intended to actually be implemented, but instead was only used to practice API Design.

**Currently WIP**

## Documentation
Documentation can be found on corresponding [GitHub Pages site](https://amonshokhinahmed.github.io/2DPathAPI/). 

## Further Notes
Also served as testing ground to try out different technologies like:
- Catch2 
- Cmake
- Doxygen
- Github Actions

Which all in all was pretty useless without actually implementing the API.
